## Details

This depends on the [`"release/v4.2" branch of Espressif's ESP-IDF`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.2) for ESP32 microcontrollers, so you'll need to use that version (which was [`the current stable version`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/) when this project was made, and it still might be). Feel free to file a bug report if you notice that Espressif releases a new stable version of IDF, and I'll happily update this so it works properly with it.

Note that their `v4.2 git release tag` of ESP-IDF has bugs, so you need to use their [`release/v4.2 git release branch`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.2) instead, which at the time of writing, was not mentioned in their stable version documentation.
